# Environment setup

Set your connection string in `appsettings.json`. The application will try to create the database if it doesn't already exist.

You can also set optional limits in the `Simulator` section:
- Limit the number of heroes by specifying `MaximumAllowedHeroes`.
- `MaximumAllowedRounds` acts as a guard.
